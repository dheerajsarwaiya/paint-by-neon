Art is more than just a pretty picture; it's a powerful stress buster, a conduit for emotion, and a window to different perspectives. A single painting can evoke a unique set of feelings and insights in every observer.

However, the journey to creating art can feel intimidating or inaccessible. We believe everyone deserves the joy of creation. We want to unlock the artist within you and make the process not just easy, but an inspiring path to mastery.

Aspiring painters often struggle with two fundamental challenges: accurately drawing shapes and selecting appropriate colors. Our goal is to address and simplify these intimidating aspects of painting. Whether you're a beginner looking to develop your artistic skills or an experienced artist seeking a new creative outlet, our website provides the perfect platform.

That's why we created PaintByNeon.com.

# How
Does It Work?
Paint By Neon uses advanced image processing algorithms to transform your photos into paint-by-neon canvases. Here's how the magic happens:

1
Upload Your Image
Choose any photo you'd like to paint. Our website works best with images that have clear subjects and good contrast.

2
Automatic Processing
The website analyzes your image, extracts dominant colors, and creates a grayscale outline with edge detection to guide your painting.

3
Painting in the real world
Print out the generated outline and color palette. Use traditional paints to bring your artwork to life on paper or canvas.

4
Painting with Neon
Use the color palette generated from your image, or mix your own colors. Click on a color, and poof! The areas on your canvas where that color belongs magically glow in a vibrant Neon hue, giving you the ultimate visual cheat sheet!

5
Color Mixer in Real World
Use the color mixer feature to create colors for the painting using the primary colors.

6
Save & Export
Save your progress at any time and come back later. When finished, export your masterpiece as a high-quality image.

Use the color highlight feature to see which areas of the original image match your selected color
•
Zoom in for detailed work and zoom out to see the overall composition
•
Lower brush opacity for subtle blending and layering effects
•
Use the eraser tool to refine edges and make corrections
